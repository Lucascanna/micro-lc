This section is work in progress.

A [composable](../../concepts/composition) application is a pseudo-HTML document enhanced with JavaScript properties
dynamically injected by the [composer application](../../../api/composer-api). 

The resulting DOM tree is constructed on the basis of a specific configuration, which can be directly provided, or sourced
from an external JSON or YAML file.

## Usage

Declare an application with integration mode `compose` in <micro-lc></micro-lc> configuration:

```typescript
interface ComposableApplication {
  integrationMode: "compose"
  config: PluginConfiguration | string // See explanation below
  route: string // Path on which the composable application will be rendered
  version?: 1 | 2 // ???
}
```

The application configuration has to be supplied with the `config` key, which may directly be or a full
[configuration object](#plugin-configuration) or a URL string from which a configuration with the same structure can
be downloaded.

> Example frame with two different applications (one with string and one with configuration)

## Plugin configuration

The configuration of a composable application is the blueprint used by <micro-lc></micro-lc> composer (being it the
default one or a [custom implementation](../../../api/micro-lc#composeruri)) to dynamically construct the page at
runtime.

```typescript
interface PluginConfiguration {
  $schema: string
  sources?:
    | string
    | string[]
    | {
        uris: string | string[]
        importmap?: ImportMap
      }
  content: Content
}
```

:::tip
Key `$schema` can be used to reference <micro-lc></micro-lc> plugin configuration
[JSON schema](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@micro-lc/interfaces@latest/schemas/v2/plugin.schema.json) to greatly ease
the writing process by constantly validating the JSON or YAML content against it.
:::

The actual page structure is provided in `content` key, and building blocks are HTML5 elements or custom web components.
In the letter case, sources have to be provided for custom components, and one can do so with the `sources` key.

By polymorphism, `sources` can be a string or an array of strings if just JavaScript asset entries have to be provided.
If an [importmap](../reuse-third-party-libraries) is needed, `sources` can become an object housing JavaScript asset
entry URIs (key `uris`) and importmap definition (key `importmap`).

```yaml title=micro-lc.conf.yaml
applications:

  # Single JavaScript asset entry URI
  app-1:
    sources: https://my-static-server/my-web-component.js
    content: ...

  # Multiple JavaScript asset entry URIs
  app-2:
    sources: 
      - https://my-static-server/my-web-component-1.js
      - https://my-static-server/my-web-component-2.js
    content: ...

  # Importmap
  app-3:
    sources:
      uris: https://my-static-server/my-web-component.js
      importmap:
        imports: ...
        scopes: ...
    content: ...
```

## Content definition

A composable application content is a representation of a pseudo-DOM tree written in a markup language (namely JSON
or YAML) that undergoes a [series of processes](../../concepts/composition) to be transformed into a valid, appendable
DOM.

```typescript
type Content = string | number | Component | (Component | number | string)[]
```

A valid content can assume different shapes, as long as it is a valid HTML element or a convertible representation of
one. It may be:

* a primitive (`string` or `number`)
  ```yaml
  content: "A string is a valid HTML element!"
  ```
* a [stringified DOM tree](#stringified-dom-tree)
  ```yaml
  content: |
    <div .classname=${dynamic-class}>
      <p style="color: red;">
        This is written following the lit-html templating
      </p>
    </div>
  ```
* a single [component representation](#component-representation)
  ```yaml
  content:
    tag: div
    attributes:
      style: "color: red;"
    properties:
      classname: ${dynamic-class}
    content: This structure is transformed into a valid HTML element
  ```
* a list of the above
  ```yaml
  content:
    - "String element"
    - 12
    - tag: div
  ```

### Stringified DOM tree

:::tip
This way of writing content is particularly powerful when used in YAML files, since it can benefit from
[YAML block scalars](https://yaml-multiline.info/) to greatly enhance readability.
:::

Instead of recurring to the ["objective" representation](#component-representation) of components, DOM nodes can also
be expressed in a single string using an HTML-like syntax compliant with 
[lit-html template syntax](https://lit.dev/docs/v1/lit-html/template-reference/).

> TODO: which lit-html features can be used?

## Component representation

A component corresponds to an HTML node, being it an HTML5 element or a custom web component. Practically speaking,
a component is an object with the following structure:

```typescript
interface Component {
  /** HTML node tag name */
  tag: string
  
  /** HTML5 attribute applied using setAttribute API */
  attributes?: Record<string, string>
  
  /** HTML5 boolean attribute applied using setAttribute API */
  booleanAttributes?: string | string[]
  
  /** DOM element property applied as object property after creating an element */
  properties?: Record<string, unknown>

  /** Node children */
  content?: Content
}
```

The type is recursive as `content` is a [content definition](#content-definition) which may itself take the form of a
`Component`.

```yaml
tag: button
attributes:
  style: "color: red;"
booleanAttributes: disabled
content: Click me!

# Output: <button disabled style="color: red;">Click me!</button>

---

tag: my-custom-component
attributes:
  class: my-class
  my-numeric-attribute: 2
properties:
  myCustomProperty: some-value
content:
  tag: span
  content: Hello World!

# Output: ðŸ‘‡
#   <my-custom-component class="my-class" my-numeric-attribute="2">
#     <span>Hello World!</span>
#   </my-custom-component>
#
#   document.querySelector("my-custom-component").myCustomProperty ðŸ‘‰ "some-value"
```
